                <p class="statement-para">My name is Emberly Smith, and I am a ceramic artist! I was born and raised in Gilbert, Arizona and have been surrounded by art my whole life. My grandma was a huge influence on me as I created my art style. I really love expressing my love of art through three-dimensional artwork. I started in ceramics in high school, and now I am currently earing my Bachelors of Art, Emphasis Three-Dimensional with a cluster in graphic Design from Brigham Young University â€“ Idaho. Through my formal training, I have learned many techniques and skills that have made me a better artist. My work is functional and <b>made specifically for you</b>. I really love the thought of having work being personal and sentimental. I really love expressing who art can be more than just a piece of work, it can be a piece of beauty, intelligence, wonder, connection, and functionality. My work can be used in the everyday life, over and over.</p>

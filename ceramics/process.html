            <p>The Process My work is made from select clays, included B-Mix, Recycled, and soon to come porcelain and earthenware. Each piece of clay is weighed and hand wedged. Depending on the piece, it can be hand built or hand thrown on the pottery wheel. When something is hand built, it is personally crafted and manipulated to perfection. Some of these pieces include slab boxes, whistles, coil pots, and slab tumblers. When something is thrown on the wheel, it is centered and crafted into perfection for you. After they completely dry they are bisque and glazed.</p>

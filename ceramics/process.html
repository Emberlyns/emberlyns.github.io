            <p class="processp">My work is made from select clays, included B-Mix, Recycled, and soon to come porcelain and earthenware. Each piece of clay is weighed and hand wedged. Depending on the piece, it can be hand built or hand thrown on the pottery wheel. When something is hand built, it is personally crafted and manipulated to perfection. Some of these pieces include slab boxes, whistles, coil pots, and slab tumblers. When something is thrown on the wheel, it is centered and crafted into perfection for you. After they completely dry they are bisque and glazed.</p>

        <div class="steps">
            <p class="step1">The first step is creating the piece on the ceramic wheel. The clay is centered and opened, then the walls are pulled. It's then wired off the wheel.</p>
            <p class="step2">Next the piece is dried to leather hard, then trimmed on the pottery wheel. At this stage things can be added like handles, nobs, and spouts.</p>
            <p class="step3">After that, the piece is slowly dried, then glazed. It's then fired in the kiln to about 2,300 degrees fahrenheit.</p>
            <p class="step4">Once the firing is complete, it is slowly cooled in the kiln to prevent cracking. The piece is then finished!</p>
